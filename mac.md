## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open source distributed version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? GitHub is a cloud-based git hosting service while Git is the control system used by developers.
3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch to split our work from the main project so that our work does not interfere with others work. It also helps keep our code clean.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? The purpose of a Pull Request is to update the local version of the repo and to show what has changed in that branch. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. You would use the git switch command to switch from FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME to the main branch.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 'git fetch' downloads objects and refs from another repo, 'git merge' merges all the different branches together, and 'git pull' updates the local version of the repo.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? To resolce a merge conflict you should open the file and make any necessary changes then use the git add command to to stage the new merged content and finaly use the git commit command.
